        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grammeowster Chef's Deviljho sausage is the most heartwarming and homey meal you can eat
            to relax after a grueling and difficult hunt. You would think since the meat is that of a 
            Deviljho it would be tough and chewy but this recipe makes it soft and tender. The soup will
            warm and hunter and make them have a restul nap afterwards.
