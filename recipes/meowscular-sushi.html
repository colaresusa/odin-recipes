        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chopp The Lagiacrus tail into diced cubes that are perfectly symmtrical. They have
                to be perfectly symmetrical otherwise the recipe is garabagg
            </li>
            <li>Skin the Tuna and save the scales for later as we will turn them in scaled whetstones 
                as they will be useful on your next hunt.
            </li>
            <li>Release the Osseoctopus back to the ocean as it is good luck to release them 
                for the next hunt
            </li>
            <li>season the Kut-ku beans with whatever spices you like. The higher the protein the 
                better!
            </li>
            <li>Take your sunkissed grass clean them under a strong waterfall, the journey to the waterfall
                will make you stronger so it's good practice. Dice em up and sprinkle them on the tail as you
                sautee it.
            </li>
            <li>Open up the Jewel Cactus just drink the liquid inside.</li>
            <li>wrap it up in a nice seaweed wrap then dice and serve! Good luck on your next hunt!</li>
        </ol>
