                <li>1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil</li>
                <li>6 large cloves of garlic finely chopped or minced</li>
                <li>Salt and fresh cracked black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>3/4 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Fresh chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
                <li>1/2 cup crispy bacon bits (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To prepare your roasted garlic potatoes: Preheat your oven to 400ºF (200°C). 
                    Grease a large baking sheet with non-stick spray or olive oil and set aside.</li>
                <li>Parboil baby red potatoes in boiling water for 5 to 8 minutes to precook them.
                     The potatoes will be more tender on the inside when roasting.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of olive oil, garlic, salt, herbs, pepper, and 
                    parmesan cheese together, mixing to combine. Add a little more olive oil if the 
                    parmesan cheese has absorbed most of it.</li>
                <li>Toss parboiled potatoes through the garlic parmesan mixture to evenly coat.</li>
                <li>Arrange the coated potatoes cut side down in a single layer onto the prepared baking 
                    sheet. Place the baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven. Bake your garlic butter
                     parmesan potatoes for 25 minutes, turning after 15 minutes with tongs or a spatula,
                      until potatoes are browned and crisped at the edges.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, gently melt butter in the microwave and combine with fresh chopped
                     parsley. Remove the roasted potatoes from the oven, and drizzle with the butter parsley
                      sauce. Add bacon bits, toss to coat well, and serve your roasted potatoes with garlic butter
                       parmesan immediately. Enjoy!</li>
